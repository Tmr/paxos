Implementation of the Paxos algo in Scala based on the following paper.

"Paxos For System Builders"
Jonathan Kirsch and Yair Amir
Technical Report CDNS-2008-2 March 2008

My implementation adheres to the paper somewhat closely.  The implementation is _not_ of commercial quality.  There appears to be a US Patent #5261085 on Paxos by Lamport.  My implementation was done for edification purposes, and has been made available under the GLPv3 open source license for the same reasons.
